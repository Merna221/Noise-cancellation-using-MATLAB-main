**Project Title: Noise Cancellation using MATLAB**

- **Description:**
  - Developed a noise cancellation algorithm in MATLAB to remove unwanted noise from audio signals.
  - Utilized the Least Mean Squares (LMS) adaptive filter and Normalized LMS (NLMS) adaptive filter for noise reduction.
  - Implemented the algorithm to process noisy audio signals and generate clean audio signals.
  
- **Tools and Languages Used:**
  - MATLAB
  
- **Key Features:**
  - Importing and processing noisy audio files.
  - Creating a reference noise signal for adaptive filtering.
  - Applying LMS adaptive filter for noise cancellation.
  - Plotting original, noisy, and cleaned audio signals for visualization.
  - Evaluating the effectiveness of noise cancellation through audio playback.
